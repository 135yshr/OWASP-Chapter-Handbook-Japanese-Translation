==Maintain vendor neutrality (act independently)==In order to preserve OWASPfs non-profit status and open, non-commercial principles it is important that no commercially-oriented gsales pitchh talks are given at OWASP events, be it chapter meetings or conferences. Such talks are not only against OWASP principles, they also blur the line between OWASP and commercial entities, thus diluting the OWASP brand name and agnostic status globally.Anybody that observes chapter leaders that are not following these basic rules are urged to report this to: http://sl.owasp.org/contactus.˜a–ó‚Í‚±‚Ì‰º‚É‘‚«‘«‚µ‚Ä‰º‚³‚¢
