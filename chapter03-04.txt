==Geographic area==An OWASP local chapter organizes OWASP activity in a given geographical area. A person or a group (the "founding members") can request to start a new chapter in a geographical area not currently served by an OWASP group.One key to a successful OWASP chapter is selecting the right geographical area. Naturally the geographical area should not overlap with an existing chapter. OWASP chapters promote face-to-face meetings and the geographical area covered should be no more than a reasonable travel for a meeting. On the other hand the area should be large enough to serve enough people who are interested in web application security and enough people to be active in the chapter.
