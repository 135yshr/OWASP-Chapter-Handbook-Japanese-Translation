==The Purpose of the Chapter Handbook==The purpose of the OWASP Chapter Handbook is to provide chapter leaders with a central place to find information about starting a chapter, organizing a chapter meeting, handling their chapter finances, and many other topics that come up in the course of running a chapter.  While there are a few hard and fast rules that chapter leaders must follow, this handbook is primarily composed of suggestions and best practices that have worked for other successful chapter leaders.  That said, what works for some chapters may not work for others, and this handbook should not limit the scope of possibilities for running a strong and thriving chapter.˜a–ó‚Í‚±‚Ì‰º‚É‘‚«‘«‚µ‚Ä‰º‚³‚¢
