==The Purpose of OWASP Chapters==OWASP Chapters exist to raise awareness of the OWASP mission, making application security visible, at the local level. The OWASP Foundation encourages anyone with an interest in furthering the OWASP mission at the local level to either get involved in their local OWASP chapter, or if one doesnft exist, start a new OWASP chapter. Local chapter outreach is one of the most significant ways that individuals learn about the organization and become connected to the OWASP community. Therefore, enabling local chapter leaders and volunteers to not only hold meetings, but also contribute to projects, organize training and events, and find new ways to evangelize about application security in their city or region becomes a key to the success and growth of the much larger global organization.˜a–ó‚Í‚±‚Ì‰º‚É‘‚«‘«‚µ‚Ä‰º‚³‚¢
