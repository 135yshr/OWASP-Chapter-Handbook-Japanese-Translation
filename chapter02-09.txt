==Chapter Oversight==OWASP Chapters and Chapter Leaders are overseen on an operational basis by the Foundation Staff and, ultimately, the Global OWASP Board. Overall activities must comply with bylaws, policies and handbooks, and code of ethics. If the Foundation Staff or Global OWASP Board determines that an OWASP Chapter Leader has not complied with these rules, their status as an OWASP Chapter Leader may be revoked. Additionally, OWASP administrative access (including the leaderfs owasp.org email address) may be immediately revoked.˜a–ó‚Í‚±‚Ì‰º‚É‘‚«‘«‚µ‚Ä‰º‚³‚¢
