==Chapter Naming==The format used for naming a chapter is: OWASP [Insert City, Region, or Country Name of Chapter].For example: OWASP Austin, OWASP London, OWASP MalaysiaIt is not necessary to specify your chapter is a ÅglocalÅh chapter, because by definition any chapter is ÅglocalÅh.  When registering your chapter name on Linkedin, Meetup, myowasp.ning.com, or any other social media site please follow this naming convention as it makes sorting and finding chapters easier.
